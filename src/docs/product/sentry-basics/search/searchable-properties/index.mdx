Sentry's search provides you with reserved keywords, like `is`, `user`, `server`, and `browser`, that you can use to search on the properties of issues and events (as well as the special case of releases). You can also create [custom tags](#custom-tags) on which to search. This page includes [a canonical list of all available issue and event search properties](#list-of-all-available-properties) as well as guidance for how to use these properties.

## Search Properties

Sentry's searchable properties fall into one of four categories: event, issue, session replay, or release.

### Issue Properties

<Include name="searchable-properties/intro-for-issues.mdx" />

- [List of searchable properties for issues](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/issues/)

### Event Properties

<Include name="searchable-properties/intro-for-events.mdx" />

- [List of searchable properties for events](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/events/)

### Session Replay Properties

<Include name="searchable-properties/intro-for-session-replay.mdx" />

- [List of searchable properties for session replay](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/session-replay/)

### Release Properties

<Include name="searchable-properties/intro-for-releases.mdx" />

- [List of searchable properties for releases](/product/sentry-basics/search/searchable-properties/releases/)

## Search Tips

Search terms should auto-complete, and when they don't that means you have an invalid dataset. If you enter an invalid search term and tap Return or Enter, an error message is displayed. For example, in **Discover**, you cannot search using a grouping function (properties with a parentheses in the key, for example `epm()`) if you don't already have a grouping function included in the "Results" table columns.

When you search using a property that's a function, if the key includes a parameter, you still need to add a filter or value to have a complete search token. For example, the function `count_unique(field)` takes whichever field you choose as the parameter and then you add a number as your value to filter on. So a typical search might look like: `count_unique(user):>=20`.

Other things to note:

- Search properties that are duration or number types are typically used with a [comparison operator](/product/sentry-basics/search/#comparison-operators) rather than just a colon (`:`) to find exact matches, as an exact match is unlikely to exist.
- Properties with the notation "Doesn't take a parameter" still require a filter or value, but don't take a parameter inside the parentheses. For example, `epm():>12`.
- Default fields/parameters in search functions can be updated. For example, the default parameters `column`, `operator`, and `value` can be updated for `count_if(column,operator,value)`.

## List of All Available Properties

Below is a list of all keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry.

<DefinitionList>

### `activity`

Replay activity is calculated based on the number of errors, the number of ui events, and the duration of the replay. It's represented as a number from `1` to `10`.

### `age`

Returns issues created since the time defined by the value. The syntax is similar to the Unix find command. Supported suffixes: `m - minutes`, `h - hours`, `d - days`, `w - weeks`. For example, `age:-24h` returns isssues that are new in the last 24 hours, while `age:+12h` returns ones that are older than 12 hours.

- **Type:** datetime

### `title`

Title of the error or the transaction name.

- **Property of:** events, issues
- **Type:** string

### `trace`

A trace represents the record of the entire operation you want to measure or track — like page load, searched using the uuid generated by Sentry’s SDK.

- **Property of:** events, issues, replays
- **Type:** uuid

### `trace.parent_span`

Span ID of the parent to the current transaction. This is null if the transaction is root.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** uuid

### `trace.span`

Span ID of the root span of the root transaction in the event.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** uuid

### `transaction`

For [transactions](/product/performance/transaction-summary/#what-is-a-transaction), the name of the transaction. For errors, the name of the associated transaction.

- **Property of:** events, issues
- **Type:** string

### `transaction.duration`

Duration, in milliseconds, of the transaction.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** duration

### `transaction.op`

Short code identifying the [type of operation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/) the span is measuring.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** string

### `transaction.status`

Describes the status of the span/transaction. Check out our [Transaction Payloads documentation](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/transaction/) for all possible statuses.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** string

### `unreal.crash_type`

The [Unreal Crash Context Type](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/API/Runtime/Core/GenericPlatform/ECrashContextType/)

- **Property of:** events, issues
- **Type:** string

### `url`

A specific URL that the user visited during the replay.

- **Property of:** replays
- **Type:** string

### `user_misery(number)`

Returns transactions with the defined user misery value. [User Misery](/product/performance/metrics/#user-misery) is a user-weighted performance metric that counts the number of unique users who were frustrated; "frustration" is measured as a response time four times the satisfactory response time threshold (in milliseconds). It highlights transactions that have the highest impact on users.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** number

### `user.display`

In order, the first available user field available: email, then username, ID, and then IP address.

- **Property of:** events
- **Type:** string

### `user.email`

An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can therefore display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

- **Property of:** events, issues, replays
- **Type:** string

### `user.id`

Application-specific internal identifier for the user.

- **Property of:** events, issues, replays
- **Type:** string

### `user.ip`

User's IP address. Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for unauthenticated users.

- **Property of:** events, issues, replays
- **Type:** string

### `user.username`

Username, which is typically a better label than the `user.id`.

- **Property of:** events, issues, replays
- **Type:** string

## Custom Tags

Additionally, you can use any tag you’ve specified as a token. Tags are various key/value pairs that get assigned to an event, and you can use them later as a breakdown or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">configuring the scope</PlatformLink>.

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (for example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language

## Device Classification

`device.class` provides a simple way for developers to understand the performance level of an event's client device in a single searchable property. This is particularly useful for projects that serve a large range of mobile devices, in which case developers would typically have had to parse through a vast range of specs and models across iOS and Android.

Possible values for `device.class` are `high`, `medium`, and `low`, indicating the estimated performance level of the device. This is a calculated property that is based on the following specs:

| `device.class` for iOS | `model`                             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| high                   | iPhone 12 series or higher          |
| medium                 | iPhone 7 series to iPhone 11 series |
| low                    | iPhone 6 series or lower            |

| `device.class` for Android | `processor_count` | `processor_frequency` | `memory_size` |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| high                       | >= 8              | >= 2500 MHz           | >= 6 GiB      |
| medium                     | >= 8              | >= 2000 MHz           | >= 4 GiB      |
| low                        | < 8               | < 2000 MHz            | < 4 GiB       |

These classifications are based on an analysis of the mobile devices available in the market today and are subject to change as the market evolves.
