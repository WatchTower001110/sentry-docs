If you use the current version of our Java SDK, distributed tracing just works out of the box. No additional configuration is required.

If you however use version `6.24.x` or below, you need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring feature enabled</PlatformLink> for distributed tracing to work. However, if you do not want to activate performance monitoring, you can also setup a <PlatformLink to="/usage/distributed-tracing/custom-instrumentation/">custom instrumentation</PlatformLink>.
